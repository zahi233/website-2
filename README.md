# Project 1 Reflection
 
This assignment was particularly challenging for me as I have no experience in any kind of coding, and also missed two lessons because I was unwell. 
The process for my site started with sketches on paper, in which I changed the design to have a background image, with a textbox with a medium opacity black background with an introduction to the event. I also planned to have a donation button as a sidebar for every page, though in the final site, I only had a donation sidebar in the homepage, linking to the donate page, containing a form. 

When I was away was when the class was taught about CSS grids. I struggled to copy the CSS grid format from the recorded tutorial but fortunately found tutorials online on making responsive grids. 

Using the grid on the home page, I divided it to give a large space to make the background image visible. I dedicated to rows to having blank and transparent blocks for the image, which I cropped in Preview so that the main features of the image are visible in the grid. In the bottom left hand corner of these 2 rows I put my dark textbox with the introduction, similar to the original site which had text in the bottom right. 
Beneath these rows I put a row for the donation sidebar as 1 block, city commissions as 1 block, and 2 blocks for "new locations" as I wanted to display a horizontal image. 
In mobile view however, all of these mentioned blocks are stacked vertically and I have given the "new locations" block a shape closer to a square to be consistent with the following picture block, so I had also changed the image to another one from the website in mobile view. 

For all other pages in the site, the content is stacked vertically in both desktop and mobile view, with mostly just adjustments to sizes and fonts.

For mobile users, or anyone viewing with a screen or window with a width of 550px or below, the grid only contains 2 columns. The content below the nav bar is all just stacked vertically, but I made 2 rows so that I could adjust the ratio of the width of the logo and heading on the site. 

What is consistent across the site is the heading and logo, nav bar and footer, which is an acknowledgement of the traditional custodians of the land. The nav bar, as well as many other elements on the site, use a yellow defined using rgba so I could adjust alpha properties to show the background image even more. I also used yellow buttons and used yellow as the background to the heading and the logo.

Consistent with what users expect from sites in general, as discussed in class, clicking on the logo always directs back to the homepage. 

In the nav bar, I had initially made a dropdown menu from a button saying "festivals", but I struggled so much to make the dropdown options successfully link to another html because of errors, so I replaced the button with 2022 and just linked to a page about 2022 festival information. 

To conclude, I took a path of choosing a theme, which I attempted to make simplistic but I think could look much more attractive and simple, and used it across the site. I tried to think from the perspective of a website user to make logical decisions about how the site can be consumed and navigated in.
